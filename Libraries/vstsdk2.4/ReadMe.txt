If you want to build a VST 2.4 plugin, you will need to put the contents of the vstsdk2.4 folder
from the Steinberg VST SDK into this folder. As of 2022, VST 2.4 is a deprecated legacy plugin 
format and the SDK is not available from Steinberg anymore and I am not allowed to redistribute it 
as part of this repo. This folder serves as a dummy just so you know where you need to put the 
relevant files, in case you happen to have them still lying around somewhere because you are are old
enough for that.
