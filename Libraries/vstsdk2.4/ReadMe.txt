If you want to build a VST 2.4 plugin, you will need to put the contents of the vstsdk2.4 folder
from the Steinberg VST SDK into this folder. As of 2022, VST 2.4 is a deprecated legacy plugin 
format and the SDK is not available from Steinberg anymore and I am not allowed to redistribute it 
as part of this repo.
